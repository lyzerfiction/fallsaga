  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <div class="faq-container">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is the game free?</h2>
      <p>The demo of Fallsaga is completely free. The demo consists of Chapter 1 only. The game will be paid after the full version is released.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Which platforms is the game available on?</h2>
      <p>The demo is currently only available on the PC platform. Once the full version is released, we may release it for other platforms. Who knows?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Will the full version also be released on Gamejolt?</h2>
      <p>No. We plan to release the full version on Steam first. We will open a Steam page when the game is close to completion. We have no plans to release the game for a fee on any platform other than Steam on the PC platform. That's the status for now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>I can't save while playing the demo. Why is this happening?</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, we are faced with such a problem. Actually, the solution is simple. When you download the demo, you need to store the files in a location that does not require administrator permission. Because the game creates a new file when saving and this new file cannot be created because it requires administrator permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>I found some bugs in the game, how can I report it?</h2>
      <p>You can make a huge contribution to fixing these bugs by sending the bugs you find to mete.ylmz180@gmail.com.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is Fallsaga?</h2>
      <p>Fallsaga is a story-based game about a guy named Marcel searching for a waterfall of legend. Throughout the game, Marcel has to deal with different challenges and encounters absurd events. The game has a good story, interesting characters, lots of dialog and puzzles. There are also occasional events with fun (or stressful, it's up to you :d) mechanics.</p>
