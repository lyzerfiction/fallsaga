  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <div class="faq-container">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is the game free?</h2>
      <p>The demo version of Fallsaga is completely free and includes only Chapter 1. The full game will be a paid release once it's available.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Which platforms is the game available on?</h2>
      <p>The demo is currently available only on PC. After the full release, we might bring it to other platforms as well — who knows?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Will the full version also be released on Gamejolt?</h2>
      <p>No. We plan to release the full version on Steam first. A Steam page will be launched when the game is close to completion. As of now, we have no plans to release the paid version on any platform other than Steam for PC.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>I can't save while playing the demo. Why is this happening?</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, this is a known issue. The solution is actually quite simple: make sure you place the demo files in a folder that doesn't require administrator permission. When the game tries to save, it needs to create a new file — but if the folder requires admin rights, the game won’t be able to do that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>I found some bugs in the game. How can I report them?</h2>
      <p>You can make a big difference by reporting any bugs you find! Just send the details to mete.ylmz180@gmail.com — your feedback helps us improve the game.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What is Fallsaga?</h2>
      <p>Fallsaga is a story-driven game that follows Marcel, a young man searching for a legendary waterfall. Along the way, Marcel faces various challenges and stumbles into bizarre events. The game features a rich narrative, memorable characters, plenty of dialogue, and thought-provoking puzzles. You'll also encounter occasional gameplay events with fun — or sometimes stressful — mechanics (depending on how you see it :d).</p>
